Testing out the hypothesis: Does lap time decrease as time goes on? (AKA compare lap times as laps go on). We expect it to decrease, given fuel load decreases. 

Ways to Test this Hypothesis
1 - Get the average lap time for each lap. This can be compared with other lap times, we can easily graph these changes
2 - Don't take the average, compare the driver stats along with the lap times for more comprehensive look

1 is probably the first step.
